This repository contains a virtual analog model of the Moog voltage-controlled filter (VCF) based on the trapezoidal integration rule. In the MATLAB file, the approximated transfer function is compared with the exact calculation of the Moog VCF transfer function. A preliminary C++ implemenation of the MATLAB algorithm is included in the file "PluginProcessor.cpp" in the C++ folder.
