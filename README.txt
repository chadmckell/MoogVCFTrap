Description: Virtual analog model of the Moog VCF based on the trapezoidal integration rule. The approximated transfer function is compared with the exact calculation of the Moog VCF transfer function. 

A preliminary C++ implemenation of the MATLAB algorithm is included in the file "PluginProcessor.cpp". An accompanying JUCE project will be uploaded soon that will allow you to use the C++ code to build your own real-time VST plugin of the Moog VCF. Stay tuned!
